# Regression Analysis


Two or more variables with cause-effect relationship between them to determine the relationship between and estimation using that relationship or to make predictions.Numerical correlation between a criterion variable and one or more forecast variables It is the statistical analysis used in converting into halo. Regression analysis mainly variables It aims to determine the nature of the relationship between. A variable as a prediction variable simple regression, if used, two or more variables as prediction variables If used, it is possible to talk about multiple regression analysis. The goal is every guess variable's contribution to the total change in the criterion variable and hence the criterion based on the value of the linear combination of prediction variables value is estimated. Regression with one dependent variable and more than one independent variableRegression with one dependent variable and more than one independent variablemodels are called multivariate regression analysis.The change of independent variables simultaneously (simultaneously) in the dependent variable.I try to explain the univariate regression analysis in terms of computation and interpretation.Interpretation of multivariate regression analysis to univariate regression analysisHowever, there are some differences.For example, in univariate regression analysis multiple regression coefficient is expressed as R (multiple R).The coefficient R is multiple (simultaneously) handled simultaneously with the change in a dependent variable.shows the degree of the relationship between the change in the independent variable.In other words, the change in a group of independent variables that are considered together with the dependent variableIt is an indication of the relationship (correlation).Multivariate regression analysis in many branches of social sciences Behavioral movements in branches of science such as marketing, sociology and psychology.determining the factors affecting the economic variables of the time series type in the economy.It finds use in its detection and projections (forecasting) for the future.

## Analysis problem and aim

In this research, I decided to do it because of the incident we have experienced in recent months. In recent months, I think that there has been a decrease in the level of people happiness due to earthquakes and viruses. So I decided to investigate the happiness level of the first hundred countries of 2019,and one of my reasons for this research was to make people understand that it is necessary to work so that they do not become unhappy every year. In this study, we take the happiness score as a dependent variable and look at the factors affecting the happiness score. I think other factors that I think affect the happiness score are GDP per capita, Social support,  Freedom to make life choices, and Perceptions of corruption,so independent variables are GDP per capita,Social support, Freedom to make life choices, and Perceptions of corruption.
